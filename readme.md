## Summary of this project

This project represents an intricate backend endeavor crafted using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, Bcrypt, and an array of other technologies. It stands as a comprehensive backend solution, encompassing all essential features expected from such a project. Our aim is to construct a fully functional video hosting platform akin to YouTube, complete with functionalities such as user authentication (login/signup), video uploads, engagement actions (like/dislike, comment, reply), subscription management, and more.

Employing industry-standard practices like JWT for authentication, Bcrypt for password hashing, as well as mechanisms for access and refresh tokens, this project adheres to best practices in security and functionality. I have invested significant time and effort into crafting this project, with the conviction that it offers valuable learning opportunities for enthusiasts and professionals alike. I invite you to explore and engage with this project, confident that it will enhance your understanding and skills in backend development.
